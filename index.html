                        the
                        CBSE
                        (Grades 1-12). The school is owned and managed by the Anandilal & Ganesh Podar Society. At RN
                        Podar School we take great pride in our endeavour to arm students with essential
                        knowledge
                        and skills; in particular the ability and confidence to study, understand, and apply – so
                        that
                        they can successfully follow whatever path they choose in life. There is something special

                            has a
                            particular
                            ethos, a rare quality of its own, which has been kept alive over the years. It offers a
                            friendly, caring, and safe environment with zero tolerance for bullying and a method of
                            study
                            which ensures that children really understand and can therefore use the information that
                            they
                            learn. At RN Podar, students are given the tools that allow them to feel really passionate
                            about
                            learning – whether it’s History, Art, Mathematics, Physics or any other field of study.

                            these tools, they can become more than students; they have the potential to become

                            Working with teenagers year on year, we have realized that the turmoil that adolescents
                            experience requires a focussed, concerted effort. As the lines separating childhood and
                            adulthood disappear, our youth faces a myriad of dilemmas not just in their academics but
                            also social interactions and personal management.

                            Life skills is an initiative born out of this felt need. Life skills sessions are designed
                            around self discovery, self improvement, and peer-to-peer support. The facilitator creates
                            an atmosphere where the young adult may feel free, express, be heard, and seek solutions.
                            Our life skills education happens through workshops, classroom sessions, collaborative
                            activities, and class-wise performance-based Special Assemblies. Grades 1-5 use the exciting
                            School Cinema modules for life skills.

                            We have seen gawky youngsters struggle with 'information overload', painfully unsure of
                            their future. We have then seen them being transformed into emotionally strong, confident
                            youth, ready to take on the world.</p>
